# ovirt-rest-bash

Translates ovirt rest apis to bash commands similar to previous ovirt-shell.

Allows anybody who is used to work with ovirt-shell commands to continue working with a simmilar command interface instead of using the new Rest API provided in current oVirt.

The methods and functions implemented were the ones I needed for a particular project, yours may vary, so please feel free to work on all the pendings and corrections you may find.

Have a lot of fun ;)
